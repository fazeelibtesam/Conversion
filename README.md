# .MAT to .CSV Converter

This repository provides a simple and efficient tool for converting MATLAB `.mat` files into `.csv` format. It is especially useful for users who want to process or analyze MATLAB data in spreadsheet software or other environments that support `.csv` files.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Convert MATLAB `.mat` files to `.csv`
- Supports `.mat` files saved in both v7 and v7.3 formats
- Handles multiple variables and structured data
- Easy-to-use command line interface (CLI)
- Minimal dependencies

---

## 📁 Example

Given a `.mat` file with the following structure:

```matlab
data = struct;
data.temperature = [20.5, 21.0, 21.5];
data.humidity = [30, 35, 40];
save('sensor_data.mat', '-struct', 'data');
````

The tool will generate:

```csv
temperature,humidity
20.5,30
21.0,35
21.5,40
```

---

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fazeelibtesam/mat-to-csv.git
cd mat-to-csv
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📦 Usage

### Command Line

```bash
python convert.py input_file.mat output_file.csv
```

### Options

* `input_file.mat`: Path to the source `.mat` file
* `output_file.csv`: Desired name/path for the output `.csv` file

### Example

```bash
python convert.py data/sensor_data.mat output/sensor_data.csv
```

---

## 🧩 Supported File Types

* `.mat` v7 (default format): ✅
* `.mat` v7.3 (HDF5-based): ✅ (requires `h5py`)

---

## 📚 Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* `scipy`
* `h5py` (for `.mat` v7.3 support)
* `numpy`
* `pandas`

Install all with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

* **Problem**: `KeyError` or `Object dtype not supported`

  * **Solution**: Ensure your `.mat` file uses arrays and tables, not complex MATLAB objects.
* **Problem**: `h5py` error

  * **Solution**: Confirm that you're working with a `.mat` file saved in v7.3 format.
